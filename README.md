Alternative approach to the probability [density analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901319) in multiparticle production.

A set of scripts to study the scale-dependent bin-to-bin correlations. The idea was to chcek different orders of the coefficients and test the method for different parameters/distributions.
